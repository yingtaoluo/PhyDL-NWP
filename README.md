The core code for understanding the logic and implementing PhyDL-NWP. 

## Get Started
#### 1. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### 2. Run code to obtain the governing equation with latent force
```
python main.py
```
#### 3. Run code to use the learned physics to inform forecasting models
```
python main.py
```

## Dataset Description

In this repository, we release the [Ningxia dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JcFkmSsqMVDcdWwcCAyhL7m-WjI3BJHg?usp=sharing) as a regional data example to run the code (For other datasets that may require access permission, please refer to the footnote links in our paper). It contains two files:

- **`NWP_train`**: Weather forecasts generated by a Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model.  
- **`real_train`**: Corresponding ground-truth weather observations.

### Input Features

The input consists of 11 features, including:

- **8 meteorological variables**:
  - `100 metre U wind component`
  - `100 metre V wind component`
  - `10 metre U wind component`
  - `10 metre V wind component`
  - `2 metre temperature`
  - `Mean sea level pressure`
  - `Surface pressure`
  - `Total precipitation`

- **3 geographic variables**:
  - `latitude`
  - `longitude`
  - `dem` (digital elevation model, representing elevation information)

### Output Features

The output consists of 8 meteorological variables (same as the 8 weather-related input features above).
